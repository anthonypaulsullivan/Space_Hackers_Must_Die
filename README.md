Space Hackers Must Die



A small python program that was built up from code by christian thompson to help learn python 
scripting and help provide a basis for a future, more elaborate game idea.

It's a playable text-based game with a hacking theme.

Can you escape using your hacking skills or will you fall victim to one of many disasters
that await? 

Your choices matter and knowledge is power.

You'll need to use a couple of real world resources to solve this puzzle, one you've almost
definetly used before and one that most real hackers use often.

It's not quite finished. 
I still need to figure out how to create the "super secret password"
And do a few more cosmetic upgrades.

Updated: The game now has an ending if you can figure out how to get ot it.
That will do for now as it served it's purpose of Python practice.
I'll play with the code to make it a little 'prettier' though.

Cheers
Antomatron
